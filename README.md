# About
The goal of this app was to ONLY use free services. That was easier said than done. I ended up using:
* [MapBox](https://pub.dev/packages/mapbox_search) for search auto-completion
* [GoogleMaps](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter) for the interactive map
* [GeoCoding](https://pub.dev/packages/geocoding) for coordinates to address conversion

The design itself is heavily inspired by combining Google Maps with Sk√•netrafikens app. 

# Features
* Tap on the map to perform a search
* Recent searches & bookmarks
* Search autocompletion
